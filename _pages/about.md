Research Topic
======
I work in the Cybersecurity Lab at HKUST, supervised by Charles Zhang and Tao Wang. 
My research interests lie in network security and privacy. 
I focus on solving the problem of website fingerprinting, one kind of traffic analysis. 
I designed three defenses to protect users against such attacks, leading to two top security conference papers.
